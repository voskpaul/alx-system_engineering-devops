A Walk Through Cyberspace: What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter

Introduction:
Billions access the internet daily for various purposes, connecting humanity in unprecedented ways. Yet, the journey from typing a URL to seeing a webpage involves a complex orchestration of web stack components.

(1) DNS REQUEST:
Your browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) request to convert www.google.com into an IP address. DNS servers respond, enabling your browser to find the target server.

(2) TCP/IP:
Your browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the destination server, ensuring reliable, organized data transmission. TCP employs a three-way handshake for connection.

(3) FIREWALL:
Outgoing data packets may encounter a firewall, ensuring network security. The firewall examines each packet, allowing or blocking based on security rules.

(4) HTTPS/SSL:
HTTPS, protected by SSL/TLS, encrypts data for secure transmission. It uses public-private key pairs, authenticating the server and protecting sensitive information.

(5) LOAD-BALANCER:
Websites like Google use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and availability.

(6) WEB SERVER:
Web servers process browser requests, downloading and preparing web page resources for delivery. Google employs a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast and reliable content delivery.

(7) APPLICATION SERVER:
Application servers manage dynamic content and interactive features. They handle tasks like dynamic search results, user authentication, personalization, and database management.

(8) DATABASE:
Database servers store and retrieve data for dynamic content. Google uses various database technologies, including relational and NoSQL databases, ensuring efficient data management.

Conclusion:
Entering https://www.google.com triggers a complex process involving DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. Understanding this journey is crucial for software engineers to build and optimize web applications in the ever-evolving world of technology.
